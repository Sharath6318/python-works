# Normal method 

# initialize instance variable ->  special name__init__
# automatically invoked during object creation 

# Features......

#      * single inheritance
#      * multiple inheritance
#      * multileval inheritance

# polymorphism -> Many form  #(more than one form)#   same name different character

#       * method overloding -> same method name but different number of parameters, Python do not support method overloading, Because python dynamic typping
#       * method overriding

# abstraction -> Hiding implemention details 

# super() refer parent class


# module -> Python file
